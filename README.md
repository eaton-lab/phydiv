# simpd
## Site by species matrix simulations from diversity assumptions

This package simulates site by species matrices under different assumptions of phylogenetic diversity for a mock community.

**Input:**
The size of the metacommunity species pool, diversity assumption (null, more related, less related), and the species richness of the simulated communities

**Output:** 
A site by species matrix under the specified assumption of phylogenetic diversity.

### Installation
`conda install toytree simpd -c conda-forge`

```
git clone https://github.com/eleggat/mini-project.git
cd ./mini-project
pip install -e .
```
