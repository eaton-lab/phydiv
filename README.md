## Site by species matrix simulations from diversity assumptions

This package simulates site by species matrices under different assumptions of phylogenetic diversity for a mock community.

**Input:**
Diversity assumption (null, more related, less related), and whether the species matrix should be abundance-weighted or based on presence/absence.

**Output:** 
A site by species matrix under the specified assumption of phylogenetic diversity.
